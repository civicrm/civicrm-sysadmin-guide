# System Administrator Guide

## Scope of this guide

This guide is for people installing, upgrading, and maintaining a [CiviCRM](https://civicrm.org) instance for an organization.

### System Administrator Guide vs the User Guide

We also have a [User Guide](https://docs.civicrm.org/user/en/latest) which covers all the functionality available through CiviCRM's web-based interface.

The two guides have some overlapping scope when it comes to setup and configuration. In general, we try to cover actions in the User Guide which the user can perform from within CiviCRM's user interface. Actions that require work outside of the CiviCRM interface (e.g. file-system or shell access) are covered in the System Administrator Guide.
