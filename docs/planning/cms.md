# Choosing your CMS

CiviCRM works with several popular open source Content Management Systems (CMS)<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.

-   Drupal
-   Backdrop CMS
-   Joomla
-   WordPress

Before starting a project you should consider how you plan to use
CiviCRM both now and in the future. Two big questions are; How much
information from CiviCRM do we want to display on our website (e.g. A
live list of our current members)? What information, collected through
our website, do we want to store in CiviCRM (e.g. Family data from a
public form with the family relationships automatically added). This is
known as integration. How much integration you require will help you
determine which is the best CMS for you.

You may also choose a CMS because you already know how to use it or it
is already used by your organisation. Each CMS has different advantages
and disadvantages and different people will give you views on which is
better. This chapter gives a quick introduction to each of them.

**Drupal** is the most flexible and has the best integration with
CiviCRM. If you have complex CMS needs or envisage a lot of interaction
between users on your website and your CRM, then Drupal might be the CMS
for you. The main negative is that this flexibility makes it harder for
new site builders to get to grips with.

**Backdrop CMS** is very similar to Drupal 7, with many improvements making 
it slick and lightweight. It started as a fork (that is, a copy) of Drupal 7, 
aimed at users for whom Drupal 8 was likely to be too complex either to use, 
or to migrate to from Drupal 7. Drupal 7 modules and themes require 
modifications to work with Backdrop CMS, though many have already been ported 
and are actively maintained.

**Joomla** isn't as popular as WordPress, though it is more popular than
Drupal. Joomla is easier to learn than Drupal. The amount of integration
available is lower than then when using Drupal.

**WordPress** is by a wide margin the most popular of the three CMS's.
It is considered to be very easy to build sites using WordPress,
especially for people that are not familiar with web technology. A lot
of people know WordPress as a blogging platform rather than a CMS, but
it is becoming more powerful and flexible with each release. The amount
of integration available is lower than when using Drupal.

The following chapters in this section go into more detail about what is
offered for each CMS.
