### [CiviCRM WordPress Profile Sync](https://wordpress.org/plugins/civicrm-wp-profile-sync/)

The CiviCRM WordPress Profile Sync plugin keeps the “First Name”, “Last Name”, “Email Address” and “Website” fields of a WordPress (and BuddyPress) user profile in sync with the corresponding fields of a CiviCRM contact. The synchronisation takes place regardless of whether the changes are made in WordPress, BuddyPress or CiviCRM.

### [CiviCRM WordPress Member Sync](https://wordpress.org/plugins/civicrm-wp-member-sync/)

CiviCRM WordPress Member Sync keeps a WordPress user in sync with a CiviCRM membership by granting either a role or capabilities to a WordPress user who has that membership.

This enables you to have, among other things, members-only content on your website that is only accessible to current members as defined by the membership types and status rules that you set up in CiviCRM. This plugin is compatible with both **[Members](https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/)** and **[Groups](https://wordpress.org/plugins/groups/)** for managing members-only content in WordPress. See the Installation section for details.

## Widgets

### BuddyPress

[BuddyPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/) is a suite of components that are common to a typical social network, and allows for great add-on features through WordPress’s extensive plugin system.

#### [BP Groups CiviCRM Sync](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-groups-civicrm-sync/)

A port of the Drupal civicrm_og_sync module for WordPress that enables two-way synchronisation between BuddyPress Groups and CiviCRM. It does not rely on any core CiviCRM files, since any required (or adapted) methods are included.

For each BuddyPress group, the plugin will automatically create two CiviCRM groups:

* A “normal” (mailing list) group containing a contact record for each corresponding BuddyPress group member. This group is assigned the same name as the linked BuddyPress group.
* An “ACL” group containing the contact record of the administrators of the corresponding BuddyPress group. This gives BuddyPress group admins the ability to view and edit members of their group in CiviCRM.

When a new user is added to (or joins) a BuddyPress group, they are automatically added to the corresponding CiviCRM group. Likewise, when a contact is added to the “normal” CiviCRM group, they will be added as a member to the corresponding BuddyPress group. If a contact is added to the CiviCRM “ACL” group, they will be added to the BuddyPress group as an administrator.

#### [BP XProfile WordPress User Sync](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-xprofile-wp-user-sync/)

The plugin replaces the default BuddyPress xProfile Name field with two fields called (surprisingly) First Name and Last Name. These field values are kept in sync with the corresponding WordPress user profile fields as well as the BuddyPress xProfile Name field itself.

To be used alongside CiviCRM WordPress Profile Sync
